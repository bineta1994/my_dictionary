## **UX**

The website is laid out in a way that allows users to navigate with ease. It also provides the kind of information they would expect. The about us page has all the words displayed for the users to see.There's familiarity and uniformity in the color sheme and layout of the website.

### **user stories**:
As a user type, when visiting a website I look at the homepage to give me a brief introduction of what the website is about, the title lets me know that the website is a dictionary.

As a user type, I want to jump from one section to a specific section, the navigation bar and the buttons help me with that.

As a user type, i found the color combination appealing and helped distinguish different parts of the website.
